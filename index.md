### About Me

I am a translator and PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.uliege.be/" target="_blank">University of Li√®ge</a> and <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/" target="_blank">Grenoble Alpes University</a>. After graduating in the fields of Modern Languages and Literatures, Translation and Computational Linguistics, I started a joint doctorate in Translation Studies (within the <a href="https://www.cirti.uliege.be/" target="_blank">CIRTI</a>) and in Computer Science (within the <a href="https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/" target="_blank">LIG/GETALP team</a>), where I explore the possibility of literary machine translation within the larger context of computer-assisted translation. One of the underlying motives of this research is to study the evolution of translation technologies and translators' practices while arguing for a radical technological and societal shift, where tools would be tailored to each individual translator and technology adapted to the human aspects of translation rather than the opposite.
