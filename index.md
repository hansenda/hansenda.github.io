### About Me

I am Assistant Professor in Translation and AI at the <a href="https://www.ulb.be/" target="_blank">Université libre de Bruxelles</a>, working with the <a href="https://tradital.ltc.ulb.be/" target="_blank">TRADITAL team</a>. After graduating in the fields of Modern Languages and Literatures, Translation and Computational Linguistics, I obtained a PhD in Translation Studies at the <a href="https://www.uliege.be/" target="_blank">University of Liège</a> and in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/" target="_blank">Grenoble Alpes University</a>. Under the supervision of Valérie Bada (within the <a href="https://www.cirti.uliege.be/" target="_blank">CIRTI</a>), as well as Emmanuelle Esperança-Rodier and Hervé Blanchon (within the <a href="https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/" target="_blank">LIG/GETALP team</a>), I explored the possibility of stylistically adapted literary machine translation within the larger context of computer-assisted translation. I also had the chance to work briefly as a Visiting Researcher with <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin City University</a> (at <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/salis" target="_blank">SALIS</a>) and with <a href="https://www.ugent.be/" target="_blank">Ghent University</a> (at <a href="https://lt3.ugent.be/">LT3</a>). One of the underlying motives of my research is to study the evolution of translation technologies and translators' practices while arguing for a radical technological and societal shift, where tools would be tailored to each individual translator and technology adapted to the human aspects of translation rather than the opposite.
